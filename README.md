# My Advent of Code adventures

This repo stores my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) adventures. Advent of code is an advent calendar where you have to solve 25 programming puzzles. I first heard about Advent of Code in 2021, but did not manager to actually participate. The year after, 2022 I did participate for the first time.
