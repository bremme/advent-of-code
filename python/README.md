Coordinate systems

XY coordinates with y = down and x = right

RC coordiantes with row = right and column = down


Overall goals

* learn some new things
* use names from the problem description
* should be readable code
* use abstractions to improve readability
* but maintain a reasonable amount of performance
* ideally every day should run under 1s
* make it clear which algorithm / strategy is used under the hood
* add tests
* add cli tool to make it easy to run
* type hinting
* github badgest
* github actions
* answer looks like answer in description


# TODO
* auto complete variants
* check invalid variant names
* list variants
* add day template
* add animations
* data download via cli
* answer upload via cli
* store answer when right
